# DataAnalytics_A6_Ryan_Kaplan

The environmental data csv's were too big to upload to Github. I should be able to email them to whoever I have to, though, and I already sent them to Prof. Munasinghe. 
(Note to the TA, I was given permission from the professor to continue my work in python, which is why its not in R)
